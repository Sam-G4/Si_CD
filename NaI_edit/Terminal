###Error run; there was a mistake 
 [ if (volumeName == "PhysicalSiCD_dE") {
  myEvAction-> AddEdep_dE(edep);
  }
  
  if (volumeName == "PhysicalSiCD_E") {
  myEvAction-> AddEdep_dE(edep);
  }] this is what I wrote in SteppingAction.cc and I was getting these results.

# This is for isotropic emission of alpha particles of energy 20MeV
#ParticleGun placed at -7.0 Cm
#Only dE detector is getting the energy deposition.
#According to calculations the efficiency must be around ~0.088 but here for 1Cr particles we get Eff ~ 0.076
#The similarity between theoretical and simulated efficiencies may increase with increase in no. of events.

#Tried increasing no. of events to 10 Cr., still not close

#Why????????????????????????????????????????????????????

#On increasing dE detector thickness from 65 micron to 4 mm (half height=2mm)

===== Summary: Events with energy deposited in dE: 9223 / 100000 ===== //How its more than geometric efficiency??????????

#Mind you! the Gun is no longer at 7 Cm from detector as the detector is placed at (000) and increasing its width increases the lemgth occupied by it in both -ve and +ve Z-axis. This may be one reason for Simulated Eff>geometric Eff. Also now particles passing from the centre hole can see the extended length and interact wuth the detector.

Then i corrected the stepping action now i am getting following:
